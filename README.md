# Nigma Galaxy  
Dear guest, welcome to our social network project Nigma Galaxy!  
We are glad to have you!

## Problem:  
Social media is mandatory for everyone to be aware of surrounding activities, news, and novelties. However, in Kazakhstan, social media software is not developed to provide citizens with a stable news platform. It also depends on the availability of the software in the region.
  
## Solution:  
While taking the problem into consideration, we chose to make a social media network website like existing cutting-edge technologies with the advantage of working without abroad companies' interruption. 
The final product will be a social network where people can communicate, share information, and create web content with the availability to make several posts.
  
## Competitors:
#### VK
 VK is a Russian online social network based in Saint Petersburg. It allows users to message each other publicly or privately; create groups, public pages, and events; share and tag images, audio, and video; and play browser-based games. Additionally, managing online communities and celebrity pages is also available in VK. Also, it is possible to upload, search and stream media content like videos and music. Furthermore, VK has an advanced search engine that allows users to find friends quickly and browse news in real-time.
  
#### Moodle
 Moodle is a platform with limited auditory. This site is the representation of the student journals. Moodle provide the student with courses, a marking system, assignments, news tape and chat with groupmates. The main feature that is important for our project is chat and news posts and since they work locally, their importance rises.
